# 2-D-Array
Given a 6 X 6 2D Array, A :

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

We define an hourglass in A to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in A's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g

There are 16 hourglasses in A , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values.

Task
Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in A , then print the maximum hourglass sum.
